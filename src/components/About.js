        <h3>We are happy to have you here, and we can surely assume that you are also crazy about cute and fluffy creatures like us. 
        We are a team of three pet lovers who want to bring awareness about how animals save lives and how important they are in times 
        like this. So here is a hint about our background. 
        We are brand new Web Developers with a huge mission this year: to put our learning into action and transform ideas into dreams. 
        So, why not use our talent for something we'd love to share with the world? Meaning, we're bringing a community of pet lovers to 
        share funny and exciting tips about our kitties and doggos and we want you to be part of it. Feel free to contact us and share your comments. ðŸ˜€ </h3>
